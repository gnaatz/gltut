# A short introduction to OpenGL

This project is intended to be a simple tutorial for OpenGL. For this LWJGL ist used. That means, not only the OpenGL bindings are used, but we also make use of the GLFW library. To not overextend the scope of the tutorial, a simple Window class is already provided.

## Setup
Use an IDE of your choice and clone this repository. Then build the project with gradle and make sure all external dependencies get imported.

## Tutorial
The latest commit on the master branch holds the finished code of the tutorial. If you really insist of typing everything with me, you can start at one of the earlier imports and try to make your way from there. If you run into any issues you can - of course - ask me.
You can try out whatever you want and also use this tutorial as baseline of your own projects. If that is of any use may be discussable ...

## Further Information
If you are interested and want to further dive into the world of OpenGL you can start with [learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com). If your main goal is game programming, you should check out the LWJGL tutorials by ThinMatrix on Youtube.

Cheers
